### What is Mobile Money?

Mobile money is a form of digital money. Instead of a bank account and a card, people get a **mobile money wallet** connected to their **phone number**.

When users sign up for a mobile money account with their **Mobile Money Operator (MMO)**, they go through a **Know Your Customer (KYC)** process, similar to opening a bank account.

Unlike traditional banking, mobile money relies on an **agent network** rather than ATMs and branches. Instead of a bank account number or IBAN, the wallet is identified by the user's phone number.

Mobile money enables users to:

- Send and receive funds from other mobile money users
- Pay bills
- Shop online
- Receive salaries

### Mobile Money Wallet Limits

Mobile money wallets have **transaction limits** similar to modern bank accounts. The most important limits are:

- Number of payments per day, week, or month
- Value of payments per day, week, or month
- Maximum balance allowed in the wallet

> Users can increase these limits by completing extended KYC verification with their MMO.

## What Does a Payment Look Like?

Mobile money payments are **not like classic card payments**. They're more similar to **A2A** or **3-D Secure** transactions where **user authorisation is required**.

### Payment Authorisation Process

When a user initiates a payment:

1. They must enter their **mobile money PIN code**
2. This code is only known by the **user and the MMO**
3. The **merchant is not involved** in this process

The user receives an **SMS receipt** for any balance change, making mobile money payments:

✅ Highly secure\
✅ Low fraud risk\
✅ Minimal chargebacks

## Technical Implications

### 1. Expanded Infrastructure

Each payment involves:

- Server infrastructure
- Internet connectivity
- Cellular networks
- USSD gateways
- SIM toolkit

> This makes mobile money accessible even on basic feature phones.

### 2. User-Centric Processing

The user must:

- Have their phone ready
- Respond within a time limit
- Remember their PIN

Interruptions (e.g., phone calls, dismissing prompts) can cause failures.
